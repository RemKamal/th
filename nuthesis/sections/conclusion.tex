This analysis note presented the search for the double Higgs boson production mediated by the intermediate graviton (and separately) by the radion in the bbZZ channel with the 2 bjets, 2 leptons, 2 neutrinos final state with the $35.9\fbinv$ 2016 dataset. Limits on the process mediated by the heavy resonance are obtained. Results are shown for the combined data utilizing both the dimuon and the dielectron channels. The mass range covered in the measurement is from 250 GeV to 1000 GeV.
