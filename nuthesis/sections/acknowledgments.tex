In the loving memory of my grandmother 
  Raisa, who always believed in me, 
  who showed me how to never lose hope, and 
  Who taught me how to be diligent with my work,
   humble with people, and tough with myself.


%%%%%%%% Start
I love reading acknowledgment chapters in other dissertations and I have a number of incredible people to thank, thus, here is my story about the road to the Physics Ph.D. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% School
It all started in elementary school when together with my mother and grandfather, we were solving math and physics problems. It was a pure definition of fun, I was never forced or asked to do my homework, neither I needed to work hard. Throughout the years, though, I participated in a number of physics, math, brain teasers, and other ``hard-science'' Olympiads. I did it just because I liked it! I was also quite busy with history, economics, geography, and literature Olympiads. However, up until the last grade in high school, I have never gone to a high level, such as Nationals.

%%%%%%%%%%%% More at School
The situation changed in the twelfth grade when I won the bronze medal at the Physics Olympiad in the Kharkovska oblast (about 3 million people) and was invited to the eliminator defining who will represent the Kharkovska oblast at Ukraine's Nationals. This was enough to get admitted to the V. N. Karazin Kharkov National University.  While everyone was stressed about upcoming exams, I could enjoy the final year of school. I want to thank my high-school physics teacher Kurochka Violetta Mihailovna, who always thought that I am special and deserve it. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% At Karazin University
During the master's studies in Karazin University, from one of the best physics professors - Tonkopriad Alla Grigorievna - I heard that our physics alumni are doing Ph.D's in the USA. She suggested contacting her previous student Dmitriy Hvostenko. Dima kindly explained everything from A to Z on how to get accepted to the Ph.D program in the USA and advised to work closely with ``The Opportunity Program'' (EducationUSA), funded by the U.S. Department of State. With my bro and classmate Vladyslav Litichevskyi, we decided to pass TOEFL and GRE exams and continue our scientific careers in the USA. In Kharkov, the local EducationUSA Adviser Bulgakova Nataliya Borisovna kindly guided us through all aspects of the challenging path that we accepted, providing us with the funds to take English lessons to prepare for exams and covering related expenses. Thank you very much, Nataliya and EducationUSA! I am also thankful to my language tutor Olga Vorobieva for improving the level of my English.

%%%%%%%%%%% About Ph.D
I got accepted to several US Universities but did not know where to go. My friend Andrey Loginov, who unfortunately passed away in 2016 still being young, was a well-established Yale postdoc at CERN. He told me that at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) he knows Ilya Kravchenko. Andrey added, ``Ilya is the real man''. Since I always valued relationships higher than any prestige or money, I decided not to go with other Universities and chose to go to Nebraska to work with Ilya instead. Later, I have never regretted my choice...

%%%%%%%%%%% Ph.D at the UNL
I would like to thank Gregory Snow, who was a HEP group leader at the UNL. He was the first person I met in the USA and helped me during my first few days in the USA. At the beginning of my Ph.D, my Kharkov bros supported me a lot - Igor Cheredenko and Pavlo Ivashyna. I am also thankful to my father who believed I can do it. He always loved and supported me. 

%%%%%%%%%%% More about Ph.D
My Ph.D years were ... real dog years. Taking theory classes 2.5 years, I thought it would never end ... However, God sent me great people to help me go through this tough period. I would like to thank my best friends Ekaterina Avdeeva, Elena María Echeverrría Mora, and Jose Andres Monroy Montanez. Without useful discussions with you, your support and help, I would have never got the GPA I have. I would also like to thank my first officemates Sumit Beniwal and Uday Singh. Later, I shared the office with another great person - Lei Yu, who introduced me to the Leetcode site, thanks! Katya's husband, Sergey Adveev, is another great friend! With Katya and Sergey, we enjoyed together nice dinners and sport activities, and talked about the C++ code. Special thanks to my bro Anas Yazidi. 

%%%%%%%%%%% Three special people
In Lincoln, I met two special to me people, my closest friends: my coach and Godfather Gennady Yashirin and my soulmate Ruzanna Gansvind. Without you two, my US life would not be that rich and colorful! You are a part of my family! I also would like to thank Lidiya Volyanyk for her mother's care attitude towards me!

%%%%%%%%%% Fermilab
I also would like to thank my Fermilab (HATS and CMSDAS) friends and colleagues: Gabriele Benelli, Elvire Bouvier, Chad Harrington, Marc Weinberg, Edward Laird. Fermilab gave me a chance to teach at a number of HATS and CMSDAS schools for graduate students and postdocs and share my experience with Electron reconstruction at the CMS, while still being a graduate student myself. This was an amazing experience!

%%%%%%%%%% Travelling and ISSO
I also would like to thank UNL International Student and Scholar Specialists - Natalia Meyer and Stephen Mattos - for understanding the need of my CERN-UNL travels and always providing me in time with newly signed documents and pieces of advice!

%%%%%%%%%%% CERN time
I have been visiting CERN since 2012 and moved to CERN full-time in 2015. I would like to thank one of my first roommates - Candice You - for being an amazing friend all these years, for making me interested in finance, and for the green book (by Zhou). 

%%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Officemates
I would like to thank my CERN officemates: Benjamin Stieger, Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez, Alejandro Gomez Espinosa, Savvas Kyriacou. Another great person was Stefanos Leontsinis. Many thanks to Benjamin for sharing the wisdom and pieces of advice. And many thanks to my bro Jose! 

%%%%%%%%%%% Banda at CERN
I would like to thank my CERN banda: Alexander Nazarenko, Iskander Ibragimov, Dmitry Ustyushkin, Ruslan Mashinistov. Also, thanks to Jetendr Shamdasani. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% EGamma group
I also would like to thank the CMS $e/\gamma$~group at CERN for giving me the chance to develop the electron identification working points for the whole CMS community. Thanks to Matteo Sani and Giovanni Zevi Della Porta.

%%%%%%%%%%% More about CERN activities
I would like to thank my bro Muhammad Alhroob for introducing me to the CERN Visit Service, where I have been a guide at all CERN facilities for audiences ranging from middle school students to science professors. I would like to thank Marc Tassera, Vanya Guerre, Caroline Leroy, and Dominique Bertola. I met thousands of people, and more than twenty times I was asked to be a part of the selfie, what an honor!
 
%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Finance Club
At CERN, I have been deeply involved in the activities of the Finance Club managing the club, inviting top finance professionals to share their experience, and optimizing the existing club's portfolio with minimization and Monte Carlo methods. Special thanks to Christian Laner for being a good friend and a cool interview problem practice partner. Also, thanks to Joaquim Creus Prats, Pascal Hermes, and Sim Tolk.

%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Boxing Club
CERN Boxing Club has been my second home for all these years, I trained people when I wanted to pass on the knowledge, trained with others when I wanted to have fun and trained myself when I wanted to push really hard. I would like to thank my friends Federico Stagni, Vittorio Bencini, Francesco Romeo, Cristovao Andre Dionisio Barreto, Andreas Maier, Vladimir Loncar, Neven Gutic, and others. Special thanks to Misha Borodin, Ivan Shvetsov, Giorgos Alexandropoulos, and Jacopo Nardulli. With Boxing Club, we were participating in a highly prestigious CERN Relay Race with more than a hundred of teams competing each year. I had a privilege to be a captain of the team of six runners several times. Each time we won the trophy. It was hard, it was fun, it was amazing!

%%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Alumni
I would like to thank my friends in the CERN Office of Alumni Relations - Rachel Bray and Laure Esteveny. It was a pleasure to work with on events with such a high organization level! They let me lead several alumni events uniting top finance professionals, who used to work at CERN, with the current CERN employees. It was a great time, we always had more than a hundred participants. Also, I would like to thank Spyridon Papadopoulos, Irwin Sheer, and Michael Botlo.

%%%%%%%%%%%% About analysis
This measurement would have never materialized if I had not talked to Lesya Shchutska about what kind of interesting measurement one can do as of now (in 2016). She introduced me to Michele De Gruttola. Michele was a hard critic, a good mentor, and a great colleague to discuss physics over the coffee chats. With Michele, we share not only the date we were born but also the same personalities. Very soon he became my close friend. Thank you so much, Michele and Lesya, for support and useful pieces of physics advice at the start of this physics analysis!

%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis group Conveners
And, of course, such a difficult project would never come to the end without useful suggestions from Higgs, H to ZZ, and di-Higgs conveners. I would like to thank Roberto Salerno and Paolo Meridiani, Meng Xiao, Giacomo Ortona, Olivier Bondu, Luca Cadamuro. Special thanks to Roberto! Thank you, Meng, Olivier, and Luca for friendship and support. And thanks a lot to Maxime Gouzevitch and Alexandra Carvalho.

%%%%%%%%%%%% The other bbZZ team
I am thankful to the other $bbZZ$ team with whom we are preparing a combination paper: Emanuela Barberis, Apichart Hortiangtham, and David Morse.

%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis Review Committee
I would like to thank my Analysis Review Committee (ARC) for a careful examining of this physics analysis. I had an honor to have some of the best HEP physicists on my ARC: Jacobo Konigsberg, Sunil Somalwar, Cecile Caillol. After the analysis became public, later, when I was applying for postdoc positions, Jacobo and Sunil (with Roberto, Lesya, and Ilya) wrote me (probably!) very good recommendation letters, since all those letters worked out. Thanks a lot, you are the best! And special thanks to Jaco!

%%%%%%%%%%%% Thesis Committee
I would like to thank UNL professors who accepted to be members of my committee - Bradley Shadwick, Peter Dowben, and David Swanson. Special thanks to Professor Kenneth Bloom for a careful reading of this dissertation and providing me with so many useful comments. I would also like to thank the whole HEP group for being a part of my family, while I was away from home. Special thanks to the best dean ever - Professor Daniel Claes for the support and encouragement! And, of course, I want to thank the Physics Department Secretary for always being so helpful - Catherine Haley, Theresa Sis, Marjorie Wolfe, Joyce McNeil, Ellen Cox, Cyndy Petersen, Elizabeth Farleigh, Patricia Fleek, and Jennifer Becic. Thanks to Professors Bloom, Claes, Kravchenko, and Snow for supporting me all these years and an opportunity to stay at CERN.

%%%%%%%%%%%% UNL HEP theory 
Special thanks to my theoretical particle physics colleagues and friends at the UNL. They always were happy to discuss WED physics with me and answer some difficult (for me!) questions: Andrei Angelescu and Peisi Huang. Each time I came to the UNL, we had great lunches with Andrei, during which we practiced French. Merci, Andrei!

%%%%%%%%%%%% UNL friends
I would like to thank my UNL friends. Great friends at the department: Shawn Langan and Shi Cao. Also, my peers HEP graduate students: Joaquin Siado Castaneda, Caleb Fangmeier, and Robert Tabb. 

%%%%%%%%%% Ilya (adviser)
A specific paragraph should be devoted to a unique person - my boss and supervisor, my biggest critic, my mentor and best friend, my tough sparring partner and an amazing particle physics lecturer - Ilya Kravchenko. When I came to Ilya, I did not know any programming. In addition, I thought quarks were as real as the string theory. That means I had no preparation for the HEP, zero, nothing! It should be relatively easy to develop a great student if you start with a good one. But that would be too easy for Ilya. He decided to work with me instead when I had nothing but persistence and motivation. I guess Ilya saw that I am happy to start the hard work and I have the willingness to learn whatever I need to compete with the best. With Ilya we went from level zero to multiple postdoc offers from the most prestigious universities and several quant position offers from the biggest asset managers. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Ilya!

%%%%%%%%%% Motivation
Also, I would like to thank people who have helped me to go through hard times without being in my life in person. I enjoyed and loved online Mathematical Physics lectures by Professor Carl Bender at the Perimeter Institute. That was real hard science, but it was presented in such an easy and fun way, that you would never see how hard it actually is. That is why now I love asymptotics and approximations so much! To keep my motivation high, there were times when I was getting lots of inspiration from the Eric Thomas, a.k.a ET The Hip Hop Preacher. Also, I learned a lot about how to remain to be humble from Jocko Willink.

%%%%%%%%%% Church
I would like to thank Father Richard Klodnicki (Nick) and Father James Dank. Your Saint John of Kronstadt Orthodox Church has been my church for years, and still is!

%%%%%%%%%% Finally
Most importantly, I would like to thank two people I love the most, my dearest - my mother and grandmother. Ma grandma had incredibly difficult challenges during the last five years of her life. During this period she lost both legs and had heart attacks. But even during this time, she did not cry or needed any motivation ... instead, she always managed to support me and never lose hope. Without their support, I will never finish this journey. As they would say, ``it is tough, but that is what makes a man''. 

%%%%%%%%%% God
Finally, nothing would happen without the love and support of God and the mother of Jesus Christ! There were moments when I was close to losing the hope, but now, I see how those were important parts of the whole puzzle.
