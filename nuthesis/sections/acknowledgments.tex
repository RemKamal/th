In the loving memory of my grandmother 
  Raisa, who always believed in me, 
  who showed me how to never lose hope, and 
  Who taught me how to be diligent with my work,
   humble with people, and tough with myself.


%%%%%%%% Start
I love reading acknowledgement chapters in other dissertations and I have a number of incredible people to thank, thus, here is my story about the road to the Physics Ph.D. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% School
It all started in the elementary school, when together with my mother and grandfather, we were solving math and physics problems. It was a pure definition of fun, I was never forced or asked to do my homework, neither I needed to work hard. Throughout the years, though, I participated in a number of physics, math, brain teasers, and other ``hard-science'' Olympiads. I did it just because I liked it! I also was quite busy with history, economics, geography, and literature Olympiads. However, up until the last grade in the high school, I have never went to a high level, such as Nationals.

%%%%%%%%%%%% More at School
The situation changed in the twelfth grade, when I won the bronze medal at the Physics Olympiad in the Kharkovska oblast (about 3 million people) and was invited to the eliminator defining who will represent the Kharkovska oblast at the Ukraine Nationals. This was enough to get admitted to the V. N. Karazin Kharkov National University.  While everyone was stressed about upcoming exams, I could enjoy the final year of the school. I want to thank my high-school physics teacher Kurochka Violetta Mihailovna, who always thought that I am special and deserve it. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% At University
During the masters studies in Karazin University, from one of the best physics professors - Tonkopriad Alla Grigorievna - I heard that our physics alumni are doing Ph.D in the USA. She suggested to contact her previous student Dmitriy Hvostenko. Dima kindly explained everything from A to Z on how to get accepted to the Ph.D program in the USA, and advised to work closely with ``The Opportunity Program'' (EducationUSA), funded by the U.S. Department of State. With my bro and classmate Vladyslav Litichevskyi, we decided to pass TOEFL and GRE exams and continue our scientific careers in the USA. In Kharkov, the local EducationUSA Adviser Bulgakova Nataliya Borisovna kindly guided us through all aspects of the challenging path that we accepted, providing us with the funds to take English lessons to prepare for exams and covering related expenses. Thank you very much, Nataliya, and EducationUSA! I am also thankful to my language tutor Olga Vorobieva for improving the level of my English.

%%%%%%%%%%% About Ph.D
I got accepted to several US Universities, but did not know where to go. My friend Andrey Loginov, who unfortunately passed away in 2016 still being in his 30s, was a well-established Yale postdoc at CERN. He told me that at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) he knows Ilya Kravchenko. Andrey added, ``Ilya is the real man''. Since I always valued relationships higher than any prestige or money, I decided not to go with other Universities and chose to go to Nebraska to work with Ilya instead. Later, I have never regretted my choice...

%%%%%%%%%%% Ph.D at the UNL
I would like to thank Gregory Snow, who was a HEP group leader at the UNL. He was the first person I met in the USA and helped me during my first few days in the USA. At the beginning of my Ph.D, my Kharkov bros supported me a lot - Igor Cheredenko and Pavlo Ivashyna. I am also thankful to my father who believed I can do it. 

%%%%%%%%%%% More about Ph.D
My Ph.D years were ... real dog years. Taking theory classes 2.5 years, I thought it would never end... However, God sent me great people to help me go through this tough period. I would like to thank my best friends Ekaterina Avdeeva, Elena María Echeverrría Mora, and Jose Andres Monroy Montanez. Without useful discussions with you and your help, I would have never got the GPA I have. I also would like to thank my first officemates Sumit Beniwal and Uday Singh. Later, I shared the office with another great person - Lei Yu, who introduced me to the Leetcode site, thanks! Katya's husband, Sergey Adveev, is another great friend! With Katya and Sergey, we enjoyed together nice dinners and sport activities, and talked about the C++ code. Special thanks to my bro Anas Yazidi. 

%%%%%%%%%%% Three special people
In Lincoln I met two other special to me people, my closest friends: my coach and Godfather Gennady Yashirin and my soulmate Ruzanna Gansvind. Without you two, my US life would not be that rich and colourful! You are a part of my family! I also would like to thank Lidiya Volyanyk for her mother's care attitude towards me!

%%%%%%%%%% Fermilab
I also would like to thank my Fermilab, HATS and CMSDAS friends and colleagues: Gabriele Benelli, Elvire Bouvier, Chad Harrington, Marc Weinberg, Edward Laird. Fermilab gave me a chance to teach at a number of HATS and CMSDAS and share my experience with Electron reconstruction at the CMS, while still being a graduate student. This was an amazing experience!

%%%%%%%%%% Travelling and ISSO
I also would like to thank UNL International Student and Scholar Specialists - Natalia Meyer and Stephen Mattos - for understanding the need of my CERN-UNL travels and always providing me in time with newly signed documents and pieces of advice!

%%%%%%%%%%% CERN time
I have been visiting CERN since 2012 and moved to CERN full-time in 2015. I would like to thank one of my first roommates Candice You for being an amazing friend all these years, for making me interested in finance, and for the green book (by Zhou). 

%%%%%%%%%%% More about CERN activities
I would like to thank my bro Muhammad Alhroob for introducing me to the CERN Visit Service, where I have been a guide at all CERN facilities for audiences ranging from middle school students to science professors. I would like to thank Marc Tassera, Vanya Guerre, Caroline Leroy, and Dominique Bertola. I met thousands of people, and more than twenty times I was asked to be a part of the selfie, what an honour!
 
%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Finance Club
At CERN, I have been deeply involved into activities of the Finance Club. Special thanks Christian Laner for being a good friend and a cool interview problem practice partner. Also, thanks to Joaquim Creus Prats, Pascal Hermes, and Sim Tolk.

%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Boxing Club
CERN Boxing Club has been my second home for all these years, I trained people when I wanted to pass on the knowledge, trained with others when I wanted to have fun, and trained myself when I wanted to push really hard. I would like to thank my friends Federico Stagni, Vittorio Bencini, Francesco Romeo, Cristovao Andre Dionisio Barreto, Andreas Maier and others. Special thanks to Misha Borodin, Ivan Shvetsov, Giorgos Alexandropoulos, and Jacopo Nardulli. With Boxing Club we were participating in a highly prestigious CERN Relay Race with more than a hundred of teams competing each year. I had a privilege to be a captain of the team of six runners several times. Each time we won the trophy. It was hard, it was fun, it was amazing!

%%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Alumni
I would like to thank my friends in the CERN Office of Alumni Relations - Rachel Bray and Laure Esteveny. They let me lead several alumni events uniting top finance professionals, who used to work at CERN, with the current CERN employees. It was a great time, we always had more than a hundred participants. Also, I would like to thank Spyridon Papadopoulos, Irwin Sheer, and Michael Botlo.

%%%%%%%%%%%% Committee
I would like to thank UNL professors who accepted to be members of my committee - Bradley Shadwick, Peter Dowben, and David Swanson. Special thanks to Professor Kenneth Bloom for a careful reading of this dissertation and providing me with so many useful comments. I also would like to thank the HEP group for being a part of my family, while I was away from home. Special thanks to the best dean ever - Professor Daniel Claes for support and encouragements! I also want to thank the Physics Department Secretary for always being so helpful - Catherine Haley, Theresa Sis, Marjorie Wolfe, Joyce McNeil, Ellen Cox, Cyndy Petersen, Elizabeth Farleigh, Patricia Fleek, and Jennifer Becic. Thanks to Professors Bloom, Claes, Kravchenko, and Snow for the support during all these years and an opportunity to stay at CERN.

%%%%%%%%%%%% About analysis
This measurement would have never materialized if I had not talked to Lesya Shchutska about what kind of interesting measurement one can do as of now (in 2016). She introduced me to Michele De Gruttola. Michele was a hard critic, a good mentor, and a great colleague to discuss physics over the coffee chats. With Michele we share not only the date we were born, but also the same personalities. Very soon he became my close friend. Thank you so much, Michele and Lesya, for support and useful pieces of physics advice at the start of this physics analysis!

%%%%%%%%%%%% Conveners
And, of course, such a difficult project would never come to the end without useful suggestions Higgs, H to ZZ, and di-Higgs conveners. I would like to thank Roberto Salerno and Paolo Meridiani, Meng Xiao, Giacomo Ortona, Olivier Bondu, Luca Cadamuro. Special thanks to Meng, Olivier, and Luca for friendship and support. And thanks a lot to Maxime Gouzevitch and Alexandra Carvalho.

%%%%%%%%%%%% The other bbZZ team
I am thankful to the other $bbZZ$ team with whom we are preparing a combination paper: Apichart Hortiangtham, Emanuela Barberis, and David Morse.

%%%%%%%%%%%% ARC
I would like to thank my Analysis Review Committee (ARC) for a careful examining of this physics analysis. I had an honour to have some of the best HEP physicist on my ARC: Jacobo Konigsberg, Sunil Somalwar, Cecile Caillol. After the analysis became public, later, when I was applying for postdoc positions, Jacobo and Sunil (and Roberto, Lesya, and Ilya!) wrote me (probably!) very good recommendation letters, since all those letters worked out. Thanks a lot!

%%%%%%%%%%%% CERN Officemates
I would like to thank my CERN officemates: Benjamin Stieger, Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez, Alejandro Gomez Espinosa, Savvas Kyriacou. Special thanks to Stefanos Leontsinis. And many thanks to my bro Jose! 

%%%%%%%%%%% Banda at CERN
I would like to thank my CERN banda: Alexander Nazarenko, Iskander Ibragimov, Dmitry Ustyushkin. Also, thanks to Jetendr Shamdasani. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% EGamma group
I also would like to thank the CMS $e/\gamma$~group at CERN for giving me the chance to develop the electron identification working points for the whole CMS community. Thanks to Matteo Sani and Giovanni Zevi Della Porta.

%%%%%%%%%%%% UNL HEP theory 
Special thanks to my theoretical particle physics colleagues and friends who helped me answering difficult WED questions: Andrei Angelescu and Peisi Huang. Each time I came to the UNL, we had great lunches with Andrei, during which we practiced French. Merci, Andrei!

%%%%%%%%%%%% UNL friends
I would like to thank my UNL friends. Great friends at the department: Shawn Langan and Shi Cao. Other HEP graduate students: Joaquin Siado Castaneda, Caleb Fangmeier, and Robert Tabb. 

%%%%%%%%%%% Grants
I would like to thank the United States Department of Energy for financing the project I have worked on. 

%%%%%%%%%% Ilya
A specific paragraph should be devoted to a unique person - my boss and supervisor, my mentor and best friend, my tough sparring partner and amazing particle physics lecturer - Ilya Kravchenko. When I came to Ilya, I did not know any programming and I thought quarks are as real as string theory. That means I had no preparation for the HEP, zero, nothing! It should be relatively easy to develop a great student if you start with a good one. But that would be too easy for Ilya. He decided to work with me instead, when I had nothing but persistence, motivation, and hard work. With Ilya we went from level zero to multiple postdoc offers from the most prestigious universities and several quant position offers from the biggest asset managers. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Ilya!

%%%%%%%%%% Motivation
Also, I would like to thank people who have helped me to go through hard times without being in my life in person. I enjoyed and loved online Mathematical Physics lectures at Perimeter Institute by the Professor Carl Bender. That was a hard science, but it was presented in such an easy and fun way, that you would never see how hard it is. That is why now I love asymptotics and approximations so much! To keep my motivation high, there were times when I was getting lots of inspiration from the Eric Thomas, a.k.a ET The Hip Hop Preacher. Also, I learned a lot on how to remain being humble from Jocko Willink.

%%%%%%%%%% Church
I would like to thank Father Richard Klodnicki (Nick) and Father James Dank. Your St. John of Kronstadt Orthodox Church have been my church for years, and still is!

%%%%%%%%%% Finally
Most importantly, I would like to thank my mother and grandmother. Without their support, I will never finish this journey. As they would say, ``it is tough, but that is what makes a man''. 

%%%%%%%%%% God
Finally, nothing would happen without the love and support of the God and the mother of Jesus Christ! There were moment, when I was close to losing the hope, but now, I see how those were important parts of the whole puzzle.
